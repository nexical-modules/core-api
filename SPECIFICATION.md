# Specification: Core API Module

## Overview

The Core API module is a system-level utility responsible for providing a unified view of the entire platform's API surface.

## Architectural Role

As defined in `core/ARCHITECTURE.md`, the platform utilizes a Modular Monolith approach. While each module defines its own endpoints, the Core API module acts as the "Schema Registry" that presents these endpoints as a single, cohesive API.

## Implementation Details

### Service Layer

- `CoreApiDocService`: Orchestrates the aggregation of documentation fragments generated by individual modules.

### Routing

- Inherits the Shell's mounting logic but exposes its primary functionality at the module root (`/schema`).

### Security

- The `/schema` endpoint is currently configured for `anonymous` access to facilitate documentation discovery, though this can be restricted based on environment configuration.
